## Features

This app was started because of the three main features I missed out by popular alternatives.


## Background Notification

The server will first try to send via an open websocket connection.
If not available then it sends a wakeup via FCM. This will trigger the app to reopen the websocket.

### Three to rule them all.

1. Security by design: No one except your device can access your data.
2. Privacy by design: The server only knows your username and public key.
3. User-friendliness: Decide for your own :)

## Bug-Bounty

twonly offers a Bug Bounty. Depending on the criticality the bounty can go up to 50€ (more later,
this is out of my own pocket :/).
